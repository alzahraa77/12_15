            <p>
                <span class="sentence">I learned the hard way.</span>
                <span class="sentence">As a senior now, I look back on my first two years at university, and if I'm being honest, they were a blur.</span>
                <span class="sentence">COVID had locked everything down, and suddenly, university life wasn't what I had dreamed it would be.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Instead of lively campus vibes, late-night study sessions with friends, and spontaneous adventures, it was just me, my laptop, and the same four walls.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Every day felt like hitting repeat: attend lectures online, do what was required, submit assignments, go to bed, and do it all over again the next day.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">The world felt so small, and I felt stuck in it.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">I didn't realize it then, but I was just surviving, not living.</span>
                <span class="sentence">There was no balance, no joy, just deadlines and due dates.</span>
                <span class="sentence">The idea of actually enjoying university?</span>
                <span class="sentence">Forget it.</span>
                <span class="sentence">I was too busy "getting through" to even think about that.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">But here's what I've come to understand, and what I wish someone had told me sooner: University life isn't just about showing up to lectures, cramming for exams, and keeping up with the workload.</span>
                <span class="sentence">It's about experiencing growth—personally as well as academically.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Yes, studying is important.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Yes, deadlines are real.</span>
                <span class="sentence">But your mental health, your happiness, and your sense of fulfillment are equally important.</span>
                <span class="sentence">And trust me, if you lose sight of those, it's easy to burn out.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">I know, because I did.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">When you're enrolled in 15+ credit hours, it feels like you're constantly sprinting.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Your nights get shorter, your meals become whatever's fast, and self-care?</span>
                <span class="sentence">It's pushed to the bottom of the to-do list, if it even makes the list at all.</span>
                <span class="sentence">You start thinking that this is just how student life is supposed to be—one endless grind after another.</span>
                <span class="sentence">But it doesn't have to be that way.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">Here's the thing: taking five minutes for yourself can change everything.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Seriously, just five minutes.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Grab a coffee.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Send a funny text to a friend.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Listen to your favorite song on repeat.</span>
                <span class="sentence">These small moments might seem insignificant, but they can recharge you in ways you won't believe.</span>
                <span class="sentence">When I finally started doing this, it was like a breath of fresh air after being underwater for too long.</span>
                <span class="sentence">You come back to your work with more energy, more focus.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Suddenly, the world doesn't feel so heavy.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">Because here's the truth: mental health is just as important as academic success.</span>
                <span class="sentence">You can't pour from an empty cup, and if you don't take time to refill it, burnout will come for you.</span>
                <span class="sentence">I've been there—tired, stressed, and convinced I had to keep going, even though every part of me was begging for a break.</span>
                <span class="sentence">But you don't have to run on autopilot.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Breaks aren't indulgences; they're necessary.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">And speaking of breaks, let me be real: it's also okay to ask for help.</span>
                <span class="sentence">I used to think I had to figure everything out on my own, that admitting I was struggling was some kind of failure.</span>
                <span class="sentence">But it's not.</span>
                <span class="sentence">University is hard, and you're not meant to navigate it solo.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Whether it's asking your professor for clarification, teaming up with classmates, or using campus resources, reaching out doesn't make you weak, it makes you smart.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">Another thing I've learned?</span>
                <span class="sentence">Stop comparing yourself to others.</span>
                <span class="sentence">It's a trap.</span>
                <span class="sentence">I used to look around at people who seemed to be handling everything perfectly, wondering why I couldn't do the same.</span>
                <span class="sentence">But here's the secret: no one has it all together.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Everyone's struggling with something.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Your journey is yours alone, and it's okay if it doesn't look like anyone else's.</span>
                <span class="sentence">You're not falling behind.</span>
                <span class="sentence">You're right where you need to be.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">These past few years have taught me that success in university is about more than grades.</span>
                <span class="sentence">It's about growth, learning who you are, what you need, and how to take care of yourself.</span>
                <span class="sentence">It's about finding that sweet spot between academic achievement and personal well-being.</span>
                <span class="sentence">You can have both.</span>
                <span class="sentence">You should have both.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">So, don't wait until after graduation to start living.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Take that walk.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Read that book.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Laugh with your friends.</span>
                <span class="sentence">These are the moments that will stick with you, not just the grades or the stress.</span>
                <span class="sentence">Trust me, when you look back on these years, you'll want to remember more than just the grind.</span>
                <span class="sentence">You'll want to remember the joy, the friendships, the times you took care of yourself.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="sentence">Because in the end, university isn't just about getting through, it's about living fully.</span>
